											<b>Hello! You have arrived at the website of Andrew Couperus, me!</b> I am an observational astronomer and recently finished my PhD at Georgia State University in the summer of 2025. I am now teaching at Smith College in MA as a Visiting Assistant Professor in Astronomy. My research efforts have studied the stellar activity of nearby low-mass stars in the solar neighborhood, alongside Todd Henry and the REsearch Consortium On Nearby Stars (RECONS - <a href="http://www.recons.org/">www.recons.org</a>). I love time series data in general and the variable Universe!<br><br>

											<b>I also have a strong interest in the intersection of astronomy and climate change education and outreach.</b> These might seem like disjointed topics, but there is actually significant overlap between the fields of astronomy and climate science. In fact, there are many reasons why astronomers in particular are very well positioned to teach and talk about climate change topics. Check out the <i>Astronomers for Planet Earth</i> (A4E) group <a href="https://astronomersforplanet.earth/">here</a> if you want to learn more. One of my main activities in this area in recent years has been serving on the American Astronomical Society (AAS) <i>Task Force for Green Astronomy</i>, a group charged with identifying ways for the AAS to reduce its emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. A copy of our report to the AAS can be <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10451">accessed on arXiv here</a>. I have continued this work by serving as a member on the AAS Sustainability Committee over 2024-2025, and am transitioning into chairing this committee as of mid-2025. Please reach out if you're curious to hear more - I'm always looking to make new connections in this interdisciplinary space!

									<b>I have led two primary projects during my PhD thesis work.</b> Both targeted low-mass M dwarfs, which account for roughly three-quarters of all stars in the local Universe. These tiny red stars are leading candidates for detecting and characterizing exoplanets in the habitable zone using modern techniques. However, the stars themselves can be quite unwieldy, hosting very strong magnetic activity that can produce massive eruptions and harmful high-energy radiation that could both prove disastrous for any potential life orbiting these stars. It is therefore critical to understand how and why these stars behave the way they do in the hopes of determining which may ultimately be good or bad candidates for hosting habitable worlds. My projects have examined different aspects of how this stellar activity behaves and changes in time.<br><br>
								
									<b>The first project</b> is an endeavor to investigate long-term stellar activity cycles in nearby M dwarfs using more than two decades of stellar brightness measurements obtained by RECONS. These data are collected regularly with ongoing observations as part of a long-term effort using the Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System (SMARTS) 0.9m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile. The volume-complete sample used in this effort consists of roughly 450 M dwarfs within 16.7 parsecs in the southern sky, with a median coverage of approximately 10 years per star. My efforts have thus far yielded one of the largest collections of stellar activity cycles in fully convective M dwarfs (N=50-ish), with corresponding cycle period measurements available in many cases (N=20-ish). The results have revealed cycles with extreme brightness changes of ~10–20%, others indicating periods beyond 30 years, and one in a 40-50 Myr-old pre-main-sequence star. Comparison with the volume-complete subset yields a cycle occurrence rate lower limit of ≥ 5.7% ± 1.0%, indicating at least one in twenty M dwarfs host such cycles. These results will be published in a forthcoming paper that is under preparation.<br><br>

									<b>My second project</b> has examined a sample of 36 M dwarf wide binaries with nearly identical components in each pair. These ‘twin’ binaries are comprised of stars with similar masses, ages, and compositions based on (a) astrometry confirming that they are part of the same, presumably coeval system, and (b) optical/infrared photometry from 0.5-2.2 µm that match within 0.1 mag. The project has assessed if these twin stars display similar or radically different activity behaviors, allowing us to inform and constrain how well we can predict the overall evolution of this activity across stellar lifetimes. The targets have been studied with a breadth of new observational programs, including short- and long-baseline optical photometry targeting rotation rates and stellar cycles respectively, optical spectroscopy studying H-alpha chromospheric activity and radial velocity behaviors, X-ray imaging to investigate X-ray coronal properties of the stars, and high-resolution speckle imaging to help rule out possible additional companions that might invalidate the assumed twin nature of the stars. The results indicate mismatches beyond 25% exist in activity and/or rotation rate for roughly one out of five twin pairs, alongside several remarkable cases showing near total mismatches, all despite the pairs' otherwise identical natures. On the flip side, many other systems appear remarkably consistent in their various measurements, despite the numerous factors that could potentially deviate rotation-activity evolution for a given star. Science has, as it often does, produced more questions than answers in this case! A first paper from this work has been published and is available <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ad9252">here</a>, and the second and comprehensive paper is nearing submission.<br><br>
									
									A few example Figures are given below to highlight aspects of both projects. <b>A complete discussion of both projects and the key results is available in my dissertation, which can be accessed <a href="https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/handle/20.500.14694/15713">here</a></b>.

The number of objects in the sample totals 455 (as of plot creation). A black dashed line has been added at MV = 11.33, which corresponds to the 0.35 solar mass transition between partially and fully convective stars, based on the mass-luminosity relation of Benedict et al. (2016). The sample is dominated by mid and late M dwarfs, which have been critically understudied to date in regards to stellar activity cycles.</font></figcaption>

The differential photometry light curve is shown, where 0 is defined as the mean of all the points. The grey number on the top right is the average noise of the calibrator reference stars, shown visually as the grey shaded region spanning above and below 0. The y-axis is inverted, so that the stellar brightness increases moving upward on the plot. Points are the average and standard deviation of the typically 5 frames taken in a single observational visit, with open circles representing low-quality visits that only acquired a single frame. Brightness variations spanning beyond two decades are plainly evident.</font></figcaption>

This only includes non-flaring epochs with both stars successfully observed back-to-back; the legends indicate the number of epochs shown and the timespan of those spectra. One system shows sustained differences in the level of H-alpha activity while the other system shows consistent agreement between the two stars. The spectra also demonstrate a remarkable overlap in continuum 'wiggles' between components in each system. The spectrum for a given star and epoch was RV shifted and continuum normalized in isolation, i.e., the analysis gave no consideration to the RV or spectral behavior at other epochs or in the other component. This means the overlap in continuum features is truly astrophysical and consistent over many visits, validating and underscoring the twin-like natures of the pairs.</font></figcaption>
